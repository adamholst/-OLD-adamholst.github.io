# Description
[MemLabs](https://github.com/stuxnet999/MemLabs) is an educational, CTF-styled set of labs for individuals interested in Memory Forensics.

# Lab 1 - Beginner's Luck
> My sister's computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system. From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with some thing being executed. When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. That's all we remember from the time of crash.

**Note**: This challenge is composed of 3 flags.

**Challenge file**:  [MemLabs - Lab1](https://mega.nz/#!6l4BhKIb!l8ATZoliB_ULlvlkESwkPiXAETJEF7p91Gf9CWuQI70)

 - MD5 hash: 919a0ded944c427b7f4e5c26a6790e8d

*I will be using [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) to analyze the challenge file.*
# Flag 1
We have no guidance or hints, so the first thing I'm going to do is identify the operating system we're analyzing with the `imageinfo` plugin for volatility.

## imageinfo
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw imageinfo
```
![](/images/ml1-imageinfo.png)

volatility returned quite a few suggestions, but the first one is usually fine.
>*Note: In some cases, all of the suggested profiles may not be correct. To help get over this barrier, you may use another plugin called `kdbgscan`. 

## pslist
Now that we know what OS we're working with we can check out the running processes using the `pslist` plugin.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 pslist
```
The only processes of interest are **cmd.exe**, **WinRAR**, and **mspaint** (only because of the hint from the challenge description).

## cmdscan
Since we have seen that  `cmd.exe`  was running, let's see if there were any commands executed in the shell/terminal. For this, we use the  `cmdscan`  plugin.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 cmdscan
```
The command `St4G3$1` was entered.

## consoles
The `consoles` plugin reads any output to stdout, so we can read the output of the above command.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 consoles
```
You will see the output is base64 encoded.

![](/images/ml1-consoles.png)

Decode the string and you will get the first flag.
```console
echo 'ZmxhZ3t0aDFzXzFzX3RoM18xc3Rfc3Q0ZzMhIX0=' | base64 -d
```
### `flag{th1s_1s_th3_1st_st4g3!!}`

# Flag 2
If you go back to the challenge description, the user was drawing something before their computer crashed. This is a hint to try to recover the mspaint data to reveal the next flag.

After some [googling](https://w00tsec.blogspot.com/2015/02/extracting-raw-pictures-from-memory.html), I found that we can dump the mspaint’s process memory to extract the image back.

## memdump
So let’s use the `memdump` plugin to extract the mspaint data.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 memdump -p 2424 -D dump/
```
I renamed the dump file from 2424.dmp to 2424.data and opened it up with the GIMP.

After playing a bit with the width and offset. I got an image with some visible writing, but it was upside down/reversed so I flipped it vertically to get the flag.

![](/images/ml1-gimp2.png)

It's tough to read, but that's the flag.
### `flag{G00d_Boy_good_girL}`

# Flag 3
The last process to check out is `WinRAR`,  we can use the `cmdline` plugin to see more information on how this process was used.

## cmdline
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 cmdline
```

![](/images/ml1-cmdline.png)

There was an archive file made, named `Important.rar` (Might be important).

## filescan
We can use the `filescan` plugin to get the offset location of that file in memory. Make sure to grep for the specific file.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 filescan | grep Important.rar
```
You will get three locations returned, you can use any of them.

![](/images/ml1-filescan.png)

## dumpfiles
To dump the file we can use the `dumpfiles` plugin using the offset location.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 dumpfiles -Q 0x000000003fa3ebc0 -D .
```
I renamed the file to `Important.rar` to make things easier.

Extracting the archive gives us an issue.

![](/images/ml1-unrar.png)

The archive is password protected, but the message tells us where to find the password. It is the NTLM hash(in uppercase) of Alissa's account.

## hashdump
To get the NTLM password hashes of the user's on the system we will use the `hashsump` plugin.
```console
volatility -f MemoryDump_Lab1.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 hashdump
```

![](/images/ml1-hashdump.png)

The part of the hash we want is `F4FF64C8BAAC57D22F22EDC681055BA6`

You don't need to actually crack this hash, the password is the hash value itself.

Now input the password for the .rar file and you will get an image with flag 3.

### `flag{w3ll_3rd_stage_was_easy}`
