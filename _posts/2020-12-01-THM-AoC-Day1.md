# <ins>Advent of Cyber 2020</ins>
- Get started with Cyber Security in 25 days, by learning the basics and completing a new, beginner friendly security exercise every day leading up until Christmas; _an advent calendar but with security challenges and not chocolate._

# `[Day 1]` <ins>Task 6: Web Exploitation - Christmas Crisis</ins>

## <ins>Task 6.1 - Deploy your AttackBox _(the blue "Start AttackBox" button_) and the tasks machine (_green button on this task_) if you haven't already. Once both have deployed, open FireFox on the AttackBox and copy/paste the machines IP into the browser search bar.</ins>

> You can also connect to THM's network with their vpn, which is what I will be doing.

- Just copy/paste the IP into your browser and you will see a login screen.

## <ins>Task 6.2 - Register for an account, and then login. What is the name of the cookie used for authentication?</ins>

- Register a username and password with whatever you'd like.

![](/images/aoc2-d1-bob123.png)

- Login with those credentials, and then open the Browser Developer Tools, which can be accessed in most browsers by pressing `F12`, or `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
- With the developer tools open, navigate to the `Storage` tab, click or expand the `Cookies` section, and examine the attributes.

![](/images/aoc2-d1-devtool.png)

- The value you see in the `Name` column is the correct answer. 

## <ins>Task 6.3 - In what format is the value of this cookie encoded?</ins>

- If you don't know the format just by looking at it, you can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to analyze the value for you.
- Copy the value from your Browser Developer Tools and paste it into CyberChef. Use the `Magic` tool, or click the magic wand to do the same thing.

![](/images/aoc2-d1-hex.png)

> The answer for the task will be the format's full official name not the shortened version it is commonly called. 

## <ins>Task 6.4 - Having decoded the cookie, what format is the data stored in?</ins>

- Again, using CyberChef, decode the cookie's value and you will see it is a readable array in the format of `"attribute":"value"`. This is JavaScript Object Notation.

![](/images/aoc2-d1-json.png)

- The answer here will be the acronym and not the full name. 

## <ins>Task 6.5 - Figure out how to bypass the authentication. What is the value of Santa's cookie?</ins>

- Now that we know what the cookie's value means and how it is formatted. We can reverse the process and falsely authenticate ourselves as someone else.
- Take the cookie's output from CyberChef, and use it as input.
- Change the username to `santa` and encode it with the same format as it was originally stored as. The output is the correct value.

## <ins>Task 6.6 - Now that you are the santa user, you can re-activate the assembly line! What is the flag you're given when the line is fully active?</ins>
- Simply paste the new cookie into the value attribute in the Browser Developer Tools from earlier and refresh the page.
- You can now change the control console and turn everything on.
- When you do the last flag will reveal itself.

# `[Day 2]` <ins>Task 7: Web Exploitation - The Elf Strikes Back!</ins>

## <ins>Task 7.1 - What string of text needs adding to the URL to get access to the upload page?</ins>

- Deploy the machine, check out the site in your browser, and you will clearly see the appropriate `GET` parameter to use.

![](/images/aoc2-d2-get.png)

- Use the provided ID number from the directions:
> For Elf McEager:  
You have been assigned an ID number for your audit of the system: **`ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw`** . Use this to gain access to the upload section of the site.  
Good luck!

```
http://10.10.165.186/?id=ODIzODI5MTNiYmYw
```

- When you are logged in, you will see a file upload page.

![](/images/aoc2-d2-upload.png)

## <ins>Task 7.2 - What type of file is accepted by the site?</ins>

- View the source code of the page with `ctrl+u` and look at what file types are accepted.

![](/images/aoc-d2-sourcecode.png)

- The file types that are accepted are `.jpeg.jpg.png` which are all images. 

## <ins>Task 7.3 - Bypass the filter and upload a reverse shell. In which directory are the uploaded files stored?</ins>

- Copy the php reverse shell from the `/usr/share/` directory that comes with Kali.
- Rename the file with a double-barreled extension in order to bypass the filter. 

![](/images/aoc2-d2-rev.png)

- Edit the IP and port number lines with your IP address and a port number.

![](/images/aoc2-d2-subl.png)

- To find what directory the file gets uploaded to, you could run something like `gobuster` that will fuzz a list of directories automatically. In this case, the directions give you a hint with a possible four directories to choose from.
- `/uploads/` being one of them, and the one that is correct here.

- Upload the reverse shell (make sure to choose all file types).

![](/images/aoc2-d2-fileselect.png)

- Check out the `/uploads/` directory and see if the file is there.

![](/images/aoc2-d2-uploads.png)

## <ins>Task 7.4 - Activate your reverse shell and catch it in a netcat listener!</ins>

- Startup a nc listener on the port you specified in the reverse shell.
```
┌──(adam㉿Harambe)-[~/thm/aoc2/day2]
└─$ nc -lvnp 9001
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```
- Once the listener is started, click the file on the uploads page to execute it on the server. 

![](/images/aoc2-d2-click.png)

- Go back to your listener and you should have a connection

## <ins>Task 7.5 - What is the flag in</ins> `/var/www/flag.txt`?

- cat the flag!

# `[Day 3]` <ins>Task 8: Web Exploitation - Christmas Chaos</ins>

## <ins>Task 8.1 - Deploy your AttackBox (the blue "Start AttackBox" button) and the tasks machine (green button on this task) if you haven't already. Once both have deployed, open Firefox on the AttackBox and copy/paste the machines IP (MACHINE_IP) into the browser search bar.</ins>

- Use BurpSuite to brute force the login form. Use the following lists for the default credentials:

|Username| Password |
|--|--|
| root | root |
| admin | password |
| user | 12345 |

## <ins>Task 8.2 - Use the correct credentials to log in to the Santa Sleigh Tracker app. Don't forget to turn off Foxyproxy once BurpSuite has finished the attack! **What is the flag?**</ins>

- Capture the login request with BurpSuite

![](/images/aoc2-d3-proxy.png)

- Send the request to the intruder tab by either right clicking any where in the capture window and selecting 'Sent to intruder' or pressing `ctrl+i` on your keyboard

![](/images/aoc2-d3-burp.png)

- Click over to the intruder tab, then the positions tab, and select 'Cluster bomb'
>The username and password fields should be already highlighted for you.

![](/images/aoc-d3-cluster.png)

- Click over to the positions tab
- Here you will change the positions to match the table of usernames and password from above
- Position 1 = username
- Position 2 = password
- The payload type will be a simple list

![](/images/aoc2-d3-intruder-user.png)

![](/images/aoc2-d3-intruder-pass.png)

- Now just click start attack!

![](/images/aoc2-d3-start-attack.png)

- BurpSuite will brute force every combination of the given usernames and passwords and you will have to pay attention to something different about one of the results
- The correct combination has a different length number. This is because all of the failed logins are giving the exact same 'failed login' page while the correct login return the actual login screen

![](/images/aoc-d3-results.png)

- You can see that the credentials `admin:12345` is the only pair that returned a different respond length

- login with that username and password to retrieve the flag!
