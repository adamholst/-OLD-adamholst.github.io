# <ins>Advent of Cyber 2020 - Day 1</ins>
- Get started with Cyber Security in 25 days, by learning the basics and completing a new, beginner friendly security exercise every day leading up until Christmas; _an advent calendar but with security challenges and not chocolate._

# [Day 1] <ins>Web Exploitation Christmas Crisis</ins>

## <ins>Task 6.1 - Deploy your AttackBox _(the blue "Start AttackBox" button_) and the tasks machine (_green button on this task_) if you haven't already. Once both have deployed, open FireFox on the AttackBox and copy/paste the machines IP into the browser search bar.</ins>

> You can also connect to THM's network with their vpn, which is what I will be doing.

- Just copy/paste the IP into your browser and you will see a login screen.

## <ins>Task 6.2 - Register for an account, and then login. What is the name of the cookie used for authentication?</ins>

- Register a username and password with whatever you'd like.

- Login with those credentials, and then open the Browser Developer Tools, which can be accessed in most browsers by pressing `F12`, or `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
- With the developer tools open, navigate to the `Storage` tab, click or expand the `Cookies` section, and examine the attributes.

- The value you see in the `Name` column is the correct answer. 

## <ins>Task 6.3 - In what format is the value of this cookie encoded?</ins>

- If you don't know the format just by looking at it, you can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to analyze the value for you.
- Copy the value from your Browser Developer Tools and paste it into CyberChef. Use the `Magic` tool, or click the magic wand to do the same thing.

> The answer for the task will be the format's full official name not the shortened version it is commonly called. 

## <ins>Task 6.4 - Having decoded the cookie, what format is the data stored in?</ins>

- Again, using CyberChef, decode the cookie's value and you will see it is a readable array in the format of `"attribute":"value"`. This is JavaScript Object Notation.

- The answer here will be the acronym and not the full name. 

## <ins>Task 6.5 - Figure out how to bypass the authentication. What is the value of Santa's cookie?</ins>

- Now that we know what the cookie's value means and how it is formatted. We can reverse the process and falsely authenticate ourselves as someone else.
- Take the cookie's output from CyberChef, and use it as input.
- Change the username to `santa` and encode it with the same format as it was originally stored as. The output is the correct value.

## <ins>Task 6.6 - Now that you are the santa user, you can re-activate the assembly line! What is the flag you're given when the line is fully active?</ins>
- Simply paste the new cookie into the value attribute in the Browser Developer Tools from earlier and refresh the page.
- You can now change the control console and turn everything on.
- When you do the last flag will reveal itself.
